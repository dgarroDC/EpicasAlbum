# Épicas Album by Damián Garro

Adds a new [Custom Ship Log Mode](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/customshiplogmodes/) to the computer, the Épicas Album. This is a gallery-like UI where you can browse snapshots uploaded from your scout.

Photos are upload by pressing the lock on button (**left click** in the mouse by default). This saves the currently displayed picture (in your helmet HUD or ship cabin screen) into your device and makes it visible in the Épicas Album mode of your ship computer.

The game by default has black and white scout pictures, so a good companion for this mod is the [Color Cameras](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/colorcameras/) mod; snapshots uploaded while that mod is active will also include color!

This mod could be a great choice for someone that is doing their first playthrough, because you can use the images to remember important stuff without relying to much on the vanilla ship log, although these snapshots don't include text that you could use to keep notes. However, I'm already working on a next mod that lets you add your own ship log entries and will be powered by Épicas to set the photos of your entries, so stay tuned!

All photos are saved in a folder "snapshots" inside of the mod folder. The "snapshots" folder has subfolders with the names of Outer Wilds profiles, in each of these subfolders there are all of the images that the Épicas Album displays (using the current profile). You can also go to this folder in your file explorer by using the "**Show on Disk**" option from the album, although this feature currently only works for Windows.

You can even manually add any image to the album by moving image files (*.png* and *.jpg* supported) to the corresponding folder, but you would need to restart the game or the loop to view it in the album. This also applies to deletion of images, but you can already do this with the "**Delete**" option inside the album and the action would be immediately reflected in the UI, a very useful feature if you take a lot of photos and then want to just keep your most epic takes.
